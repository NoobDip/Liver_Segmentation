# UNet Medical Image Segmentation Model

## Overview

This Python script (`model.py`) implements a 3D U-Net model for medical image segmentation using the MONAI library. The U-Net architecture is widely used for semantic segmentation tasks in medical imaging. The script includes data preparation, model definition, training loop, and evaluation functions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch
- MONAI library
- NumPy

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The `prepare` function loads and preprocesses medical image data. It includes transformations such as resizing, intensity scaling, and normalization.

2. **Model Definition:**
   - The script uses a 3D U-Net model with customizable parameters such as input channels, output channels, number of layers, and normalization type.

3. **Loss Function and Optimizer:**
   - The model is trained using the Dice Loss. You can customize the loss function and optimizer in the script.

4. **Training:**
   - The `train` function trains the model using the provided data loaders. It includes options for saving the best model based on evaluation metrics during training.

5. **Run the Script:**
   - To train the model, modify the `data_in` variable to provide the data loaders and set the desired parameters. Run the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python model.py
     ```

6. **Results:**
   - The script saves training and evaluation metrics, as well as the best-performing model.

## Script Organization

- **Data Loading:** The script uses MONAI's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes for loading and batching medical image data.

- **Model Architecture:** The U-Net model is defined using MONAI's `UNet` class with customizable parameters.

- **Training Loop:** The training loop is implemented in the `train` function, which includes options for saving training and evaluation metrics.

- **Loss Function:** The script uses the Dice Loss for training the segmentation model.

- **Optimizer:** The Adam optimizer is used with customizable learning rates and weight decay.

## Customization

- **Model Architecture:** Adjust the U-Net architecture by modifying the parameters passed to the `UNet` class.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Customize data preprocessing transformations in the `prepare` function.

- **Training Parameters:** Modify the training parameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate, and evaluation interval.

- **File Paths:** Set the paths for training and testing data directories, as well as the directory to save model weights and metrics.
